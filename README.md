# Space-Wars
A 2D shooter game in Python

So like, um, it is a game, you shoot, you kill, you dodge, you don't die, collect the drops though. 
Also bullets collide and annhilate each other.

The code is such that the game automatically scales itself according to almost any screen size

External libraries used: Numpy and PIL
